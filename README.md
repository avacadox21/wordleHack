# Wordle Hack

This is the first ever official hack in order to get answers to daily wordle answers.

## Prerequisites

- Git
- Node.js
- NO LIFE

## How does this work?

This program or hack scrapes the answers from the [this](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) website (it is in it's localStorage)
I feel bad for the developer of this website that they couldn't make it secure enough _wheezes_.

## How do I use this?

Install Git and Node.js

- Then clone this repo
- go to the directory and `npm install`
- `npm run start ` or `node .`

## Damn who made this?

me. they call me ava-god-ox21
