# Wordle Hack
This is the first ever official hack in order to get answers to daily wordle answers.

## Prerequisites

 - Git 
 - Node.js
 - NO LIFE

## How does this work?
This program or hack scrapes the answers from the [this](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) website (it is in it's localStorage)
I feel bad for the developer of this website that they couldn't make it secure enough *wheezes*.

## How do I use this?
Install Git and Node.js

 - Then clone this repo
 - go to the directory and `npm install`
 - `node . ` or `node index.js`

## Damn who made this?
me. they call me ava-god-ox21
